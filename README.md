## Aim of this project
Based on the dataset, various factors such as category, month, state, and customer can influence the return rate in the Superstore dataset. The purpose of this dashboard was to analyze the Superstore.xls dataset and provide valuable insights into its current return rates. As assigned by the CEO, my task was to identify the most significant factors that can impact returns. These included determining the months with the highest return rate, the category that contributed the most to returns, the customers with the highest return rates, and the states with the highest return rates. By answering these questions, we aimed to better understand the key factors influencing returns and to provide actionable solutions for Superstore to reduce return rates and increase overall performance.
 ## Target audience
 The target audience for this project included:
1. CEO: The objective was to identify the key factors contributing to a high return rate and develop effective policies to mitigate the issue.
2.	Store manager: The purpose of this initiative was to empower store managers with valuable insights derived from the CEO's policies.
3.	Store supervisor: The purpose of this initiative was to utilize the insights gained from the analysis to ensure that the workers align their practices with the CEO's guidelines.

The project's primary goal was to equip the CEO with actionable insights, allowing them to comprehend the crucial factors driving customer returns and formulate effective strategies to mitigate and reduce the volume of returned orders. To achieve this, the Dashboard facilitated an extensive analysis of multiple variables, including product categories, shipping methods, customer profiles, and order attributes. This analysis uncovered patterns and identified the underlying causes of the high return rate.
